# Frontend Mentor - Minimal Pricing Tiers Challenge

Welcome! Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. 

Your task is to build out the project to the design inside the `/design` folder.

The design shows one 'Buy' call-to-action, whereas you'll see that each tier has a Buy button in the `index.html`. As part of the challenge, make it so that the styles change depending on the pricing tier that is being hovered over by the user. Style guidelines are as follows:

- Middle tier should be selected/active on page load
- The Buy call-to-action should appear for the tier that has been hovered and the buttons on the inactive tiers should disappear
- The `box-shadow` on the hovered tier should be changed to add emphasis to the element

Try to complete the JavaScript side of the project **without loading in jQuery**.

If you decide to push the project live, tweet **@frontendmentor** once you're finished with your URL in the tweet. I'd love to take a look at what you've built!

Feedback is always welcome, so if you have any regarding this challenge please email me at matt[at]frontendmentor[dot]io.

Have fun building!
